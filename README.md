# The genetic basis of the island rule in birds

This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce all analyses. 

- Within `docs/1.0_methods.md`  you will find the full pipeline and where Iâ€™ve run each script (whether in *ARC*, the University of Oxford cluster that uses SLURM or *Nesoi*, our local server) . 

- The folder `analysis` contains specific scripts for each of the analyses. `notebooks/R` contains R scripts to reproduce the figures. 

- `src` contains custom and other scripts that are used in `1.0_methods.md`.

Raw data, intermediate files and final output will be uploaded to Dryad and a link will be made available soon.

Feel free to drop me an email (andrea.estandia@biology.ox.ac.uk) if you have any questions.
